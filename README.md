# State Estimation and Localization for Self-Driving Cars

## Run

Refer the [source code](https://github.com/Karthik-Rajgopal/Self-driving-car-coursera/blob/main/Extended_Kalman_Filter.ipynb) (ipynb file).

## Algorithm Used

### Error-State Extended Kalman Filter (ES-EKF)

- Algorithm is implemented using Python3 programming language.
- Dataset containing measurements from a sensor array involving IMU, a GNSS receiver, and a LiDAR on a moving self-driving car is used for the development of the Kalmna filter.
- A reasonable estimate of the vehicle's pose and velocity is derived using sensor fusion and compared with ground truth data from the CARLA simulator.
